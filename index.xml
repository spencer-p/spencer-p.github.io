      <title>The Cake Pizza</title>

      <description>One of the most memorable pizzas I had was a giant, inches-tall dutch-oven shaped piece of bread with a more conventional pizza resting on top. I probably liked it so much because it was served in the cold forest at night after a long hike, but that won&amp;rsquo;t stop me from trying to recreate this ultimate sicilian pizza.
Attempt #1 I don&amp;rsquo;t have a dutch oven in the required size, and I am additionally afraid of making something too accurate and disliking it.</description>

      <title>Effective systemd: Where Are My Backups?</title>

      <description>Backups are important. Good backups are tested long before the disaster they are meant to recover from. With this in mind, I checked my backups today:
$ sudo tarsnap --list-archives | sort [sudo] password for spencer: localhost-2020-08-02_15-25-38 localhost-2020-11-02_00-00-06 Hold on - there should be five of them since August, and I only see two.
My laptop isn&amp;rsquo;t always on, which is why I set up my backup system on a systemd timer.</description>

      <description>#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { printf(&amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34;); } Oh no, another gravestone of the modern web: some developer&amp;rsquo;s personal blog.</description>
