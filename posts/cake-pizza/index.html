		<p>One of the most memorable pizzas I had was a giant, inches-tall dutch-oven
shaped piece of bread with a more conventional pizza resting on top. I probably
liked it so much because it was served in the cold forest at night after a long
hike, but that won&rsquo;t stop me from trying to recreate this ultimate sicilian
pizza.</p>
<h1 id="attempt-1">Attempt #1</h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a dutch oven in the required size, and I am additionally afraid of
making something too accurate and disliking it. Instead, I will make it in a
deep casserole dish, a sort of beefed-up focaccia if you will.</p>
<p>I want high hydration for a thick bread-y pizza. The toppings are not as
complicated as the dough.</p>
<h2 id="the-recipe">The recipe</h2>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<ul>
<li>75% hydration</li>
<li>2% salt</li>
<li>1.5% yeast</li>
<li>2-3% oil
<ul>
<li>Oil is key to depth of flavor for a dough-heavy pizza.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2-3% sugar
<ul>
<li>Sugar is a unique feature of American pizza dough. I am not sure if I would
like with or without sugar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This puts us at about 182% of the weight of the flour. I don&rsquo;t know exactly how
much dough is needed, so I&rsquo;ll be working backwards from the amount of flour that
fits in half of my baking dish.</p>
<p>For the topping:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canned tomato. Crushed, whole, or sauce, depending on desired effort.</li>
<li>Mozzarella  block.</li>
<li>Fresh basil</li>
</ul>
<p>The method will be to mix and prepare the dough a day in advance. When the day
comes, I will warm the dough at room temperature until risen in the casserole
dish. I will top the pizza and bake it for 25 minutes at 500°F, or until the
internal temperature reaches 190°F.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-result">The first result</h2>
<p>I used 500g of bread flour and about a cup each of sauce and cheese.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cake-pizza-1.webp" alt="A slice of the first attempt"></p>
<p><strong>The good:</strong> The pizza was a good one to two inches tall and satisfied my desire for
bready pizza fresh out of the oven.</p>
<p><strong>The bad:</strong> I overcooked the pizza. The dough was internally 210°F and the cheese
was burnt in some places. The cheese being burnt is not so bad, but dry dough
is. The pizza stuck to the casserole dish - this could be a combination of not
enough oil as well as overcooking.</p>
<p><strong>The ugly:</strong> The dough had difficulty supporting the weight of the sauce and
cheese. Sauce pressed down and made pockets in the dough.</p>
<p>The topping pressure suggests there is a maximum height to this pizza without
changing the recipe. You either need to sacrifice fluffiness in the dough and
make it dense, or pre-bake the dough and add the topping once the dough is set.
In my next attempt, I will try the blind baking method.</p>
<h1 id="attempt-2">Attempt #2</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use the same method as before, with the following modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>More liberal oil on the casserole dish</li>
<li>Cut the baking time down to 20 minutes total</li>
<li>First ten minutes will be just the dough</li>
<li>Add the toppings halfway through, then finish for ten minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>After 20 minutes, I will test the temperature and make sure it gets up to
190°F internally.</p>
<p>I predict this method will result in a taller pizza with a more
consistently-baked dough and a fresh layer of topping.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-result">The second result</h2>
<p>As predicted, the modified recipe resulted in a more even bake throughout the
dough that stood up to the weight of the sauce and cheese. It cooked evenly, had
a crust without burning, and was moist and fluffy. It was not significantly
taller than the previous iteration, but the more sturdy dough structure made it
feel as though it was.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cake-pizza-2.webp" alt="A cross section of the second attempt"></p>
<p>While the first attempt had an awkward gradient from dough to cheese, this
second attempt was clearly a piece of bread with a pizza on top. (Yes, that&rsquo;s a
good thing.)</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The pizza I made does not compare to the monstrous pizza of my memory. But it is
delightful, filling, and clearly what it was meant to be: an overgrown sicilian
pizza, a loaf of bread with tomato and cheese.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
